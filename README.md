## Mallorytypes

![Vercel Deploy](https://deploy-badge.vercel.app/vercel/mallorytypes-rebuild)

This is my personal site, built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and hosted on [Vercel.com](https://vercel.com/themallens-projects).

It is mostly a straightforward Next.JS app, with a couple interesting features such as an API route for sending email using [nodemailer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemailer) and a canvas based particle simulation that interacts with the user's mouse.
